          <p>
            After receiving a Bachelors Degree in Graphic Design, I have obtained about 3 years of experience developing eLearning courses. I will be graduating from California State University at Fullerton with a Masters Degree in Instructional
            Design and
            Technology this May. I am currently compiling research on the methodologies and theories used in enhancing a critical thinking disposition in adolescents with eLearning. Specific topics included in my research are: educational psychology
            as it
            applies to adolescents, the link between Blooms Taxonomy and online course activities and interactions, managing cognitive load, transformative learning theory, cognitive learning theory, the mastery learning method, the concept
            attainment model,
            and role-playing. My goal is to create online learning environments that are respectful, collaborative, and that are conducive to developing a critical thinking disposition.
